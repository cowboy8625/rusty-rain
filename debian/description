animation in your terminal.

Users can configure the rain characters, colors, directions, and speed using
various command line options. Supported character sets include alphabets,
numbers, emojis, playing cards, and more.

Installation is simple using Cargo or Docker, and the program exits cleanly with
ESC or Ctrl+C.

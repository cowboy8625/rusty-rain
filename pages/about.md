# About Rusty Rain Development


I created Rusty Rain a while ago while trying to learn Rust, and it was an incredibly enjoyable experience!

The [version 0.1.0](https://github.com/cowboy8625/rusty-rain/tree/v0.0.1) marked the first attempt, and let me tell you, I had no clue what I was doing back then. It was slow and poorly designed, to say the least.

As I delved deeper into learning about Data-Oriented Design (DOD), I became increasingly intrigued. To put this new design pattern to the test, I created a new branch named [DOD](https://github.com/cowboy8625/rusty-rain/tree/dod) and essentially started from scratch.

Surprisingly, implementing DOD was relatively straightforward. But did it make a difference in performance?

I'd estimate about a 90% improvement! The CPU usage plummeted from 98% to just 2-5%, depending on the options given. However, shading the characters can still result in more draw calls and slightly higher CPU usage.

# Installing

Currently there is no pre-built binary for rusty rain and so you will need to build
it from source.

# Cargo

If you have rust installed then just use cargo
```bash
cargo install rusty-rain
```

# Cloning
You can also clone the project and build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cowboy8625/rusty-rain
cd rusty-rain
cargo install path .
```

# Coming Soon

I am working for a app image and other ways to install rusty rain
- [ ] Linux Debian `apt install rusty-rain`
- [ ] Linux AUR
- [ ] Window's Chocolaty
- [ ] Mac Home Brew
